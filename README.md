# BlockChain Gambling

## rough outline for functionality of creating and placing bets

### basic level
We can pull odds from here  
https://www.oddsshark.com/mlb  

- Allow a person to pick a game and what type of bet that want to create.  
- But, they can pick their own numbers for the lines - we could display the odds book's lines as a reference point  
- They select the max amount of tokens they're willing to lose
- When somebody wants to place a bet instead of create one, we could sort by sports
- Inside that sport, we could display all bets but allow filtering by bet-type
- If they filter by bet-type, We could display all available bets sorted by the line. And we could
include what the odds book's line is for a point of reference  

### advanced
I liked to be able to allow parlaying but it's tricky since not bettor
would likely not be combining all bets from one person. Solutions to this:
- Allow an individual to select the option for their bet to included in a parlay
- Then, for someone looking for bets, they could diversify their bets only amongst
those willing to participate and therefore if the bettor wins, the creators of 
all of those bets will have essentially consented to having to pay out more than what their bet is worth to 
cover the cost of the winner
- This is definitely not something we need for the project, but if we have extra time,
it would make the "gambling" more legit and I don't think would be too hard to implement.
